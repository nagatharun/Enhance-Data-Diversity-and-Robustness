# Enhance-Data-Diversity-and-Robustness
Using the Cholecseg8k dataset,
We are not using the cholec80 dataset or endovis dataset for now because he datasets are not annotated therefore manual annotation is required, another method to do this is to bootstrap but this is tbd
The cholecseg8k dataset has various masks for each mask so we are using this a present to get the baseline scores.
